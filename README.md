# 🎓 START UKM – Guest House Booking System for Students & Staff
Hey there! 👋  
This is my Final Year Project (FYP) – a simple and student-friendly web system to help UKM students and staff book guest houses online. No more confusing emails or manual forms!
--

## 💡 What's This Project About?
At UKM, booking guest houses has always been done manually. Students often don’t even know the houses exist or how to book them. So I built this system to make the whole process clearer, faster, and online!
Whether it’s for events like convocation or just a short stay on campus — this system makes booking easier.

 ✨ Main Features
- 🧑‍🎓 Student login using matrix number (UKM students only)
- 🏘️ View available guest houses by college
- 📅 Pick your dates & submit bookings online
- 📋 See booking history and summaries
- 🛠️ Admin panel to review and manage bookings
---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Here’s what I used to build it:

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – for the frontend
- **PHP** – for backend functions
- **MySQL** – to store booking data
- **phpMyAdmin** – to manage the database
- **Sublime Text & XAMPP** – for local development

🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This
I noticed many students didn’t know how to book guest houses at UKM, and the current process was a bit messy. So I created this system to:
- Help students and staff make bookings easily
- Avoid double bookings or confusion
- Support UKM events where temporary stay is needed
